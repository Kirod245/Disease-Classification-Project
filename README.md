# ImageNet training in PyTorch

## About

This Ai uses x-ray images to dicern whether or not someone has pneumonia! In this project we will be retraining an image classification model.

## Getting started 

To start head to: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia 
download and unzip the zip file (This will most likley take a while so dont worry to much)

Scp this dataset into your nano now, if you forgot the command will look smth like this: scp C:\Users\username\.. user_name@ip_adress:/home/Nvidia_username/wherever you want it 

I personally have everything in jetson_inference/python/training/classification

you will need to have intalled pytorch, if you are missing anything use the pip install command
